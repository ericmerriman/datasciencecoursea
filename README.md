This is a readme for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
Each step is preceeded in the text with a comment referring to the start of each step.  
The last setep, step 5, is not commented out but is the part with the i and j index.  
Basically a empty data frame is being used to complie a row-wise breakdown of mean of each measurement by subject 
and activity.  Row names ARE used in my output.
